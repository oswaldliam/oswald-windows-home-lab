# Liam Oswald's Home Lab Documentation 

## Goal:
Establish a professional server environment for personal learning. 

## Project 1: Initializing Hypervisor and Operating System
- **Hypervisor**: VMware Workstation Pro 25H2u1 (Type-2)
- **Status**: Complete
- **Steps Taken**:
  - [x] Established Windows Server 2025 on VMware Workstation Pro

  - [x] Manually assigned static IPv4 address and custom computer name (domainControl)
  - [x] Manually assigned the preferred DNS address to match the static IPv4 address to ensure smooth Active Directory promotion 
  - [x] OS hardened with Windows updates and assigning the administrator's password
 
  ### Project 1 Challenges and Resolutions
  - **Challenge**: Required IP address information in order to assign static addresses
  - **Resolution**: Use of the `ipconfig` command to identify my Default Gateway; researched how to generate a static IPv4 address based off of the Default Gateway address
    
## Project 2: Initializing Active Directory
- **Status**: Complete
- **Steps Taken**:
  - [x] Used Add Roles and Features Wizard to install Active Directory Domain Services 
  - [x] Established the forest root domain (homelabad.lab.local) 
  - [x] Established fundamental domain services; Forest functional level and Domain functional level to Windows Server 2025 and set the Directory Service Restore Mode password
  - [x] Defaulted on NetBIOS domain name and default Database/Log file/SYSVOL folders
  - [x] Verified with Active Directory Users and Computers

  - [x] Generated OUs for a tiered OU structure in Active Directory Users and Computers to establish different administration levels and organize GPOs

### Project 2 Challenges and Resolutions
  - **Challenge**: Required a fully qualified forest root domain name, but I didn't have a publicly registered domain name
  - **Resolution**: Research led to using .lab.local; attempted using .home.arpa but this lead to dynamic registrations being generated in the reverse lookup zone rather than the forward lookup zone. 

## Project 3: DNS Initial Configuration 
- **Status**: Complete
- **Steps Taken**:
  - [x] Configured DNS Forwarder for more reliable external name resolution (8.8.8.8 dns.google)
  - [x] Created a IPv4 Reverse Lookup Zone for future utility in diagnostics and security 
  - [x] Verified using the DC's IPv4 address and domain name in `nslookup` command to confirm forward and reverse resolution 
  - [x] Enabled DNS scavenging of stale records (7 days) to keep the home lab lightweight and reduce possible conflicts
  - [x] Hardened the DNS server by restricting the listener to the DC's static IPv4 address

 ### Project 3 Challenges and Resolutions
  - **Challenge**: Initial `nslookup` to the Reverse Lookup Zone did not return with the host name
  - **Resolution**: Identified the reverse lookup zone did not have a PTR so one was manually added; verified resolution in both directions with `nslookup`
        
## Project 4: Active Directory Replication and Availability 
- **Status**: Complete
- **Steps Taken**:
  - [x] Established another Windows Server 2025 on VMware Workstation Pro
  - [x] Manually assigned static IPv4 address in sequence with the original DC (domainControl) and assigned a custom computer name (replicaControl)
  - [x] Manually assigned the preferred DNS address to match the static IPv4 address of domainControl and the alternate DNS address to 127.0.0.1
  - [x] Hardened the OS with Windows updates and the assignment of an administrator's password
  - [x] Joined replicaControl to the homelabad.lab.local domain to confirm connection and DNS resolution

  - [x] Used Add Roles and Features Wizard to install Active Directory Domain Services on replicaControl
  - [x] Promoted replicaControl to a replica domain controller
  - [x] Confirmed DNS zones and AD objects synchronized

 ### Project 4 Challenges and Resolutions
  - **Challenge 1**: Attempted to `ping` domainControl's IPv4 address on replicaControl's command line but it could not be reached 
  - **Resolution 1**: Research led to enabling an inbound rule (File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)) in domainControl's Windows Defender Firewall allowing for inbound pings
  - **Challenge 2**: Router traffic caused DNS resolution conflicts 
  - **Resolution 2**: Research led to updating the virtual infrastructure to an isolated VMware LAN in order to remove interference 

## Project 5: Client Intergration (Manual Bootstrap)
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Steps Taken**:
  - [x] Established another Windows Server 2025 on VMware Workstation Pro to serve as the client machine
  - [x] Hardened the OS with Windows updates and the assignment of an administrator's password
  - [x] Manually assigned static IPv4 address in sequence with the domain controllers
  - [x] Updated client's virtual infrastructure to the same isolated VMware LAN as the domain controllers
  - [x] Manually assigned a computer name (homelabclient) and joined it to the homelabad.lab.local domain
  - [x] Verified domain name resolution with `nslookup` and confirmed the client identified both domain controllers

  ### Project 5 Challenges and Resolutions
  - **Challenge**: Client hardening with Windows updates required
  - **Resolution**: Initially established VM in a bridged network configuration and proceeded with hardening, then went back to update the VM network configuration to share the same LAN segment as the domain controllers.
